## Development guidelines

We have a few development guidelines regarding the code, that we try to follow as much as possible.
  - We try to stick as much as possible with ES6 (https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) and ES2016+ (http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/).
    We keep the support of Firefox Stable as our main focus.
  - We don't add any new library without prior discussion and not unless we are convinced that the benefits are largely worth it.
  - Every method must be properly documented.
